# Tutorials

A tutorial:

* is learning-oriented
* allows the newcomer to get started
* is a lesson

*Analogy: teaching a small child how to cook*


## Your first Roll application

Make sure you [installed Roll first](how-to/basic.md#how-to-install-roll).

The tinyest application you can make is this one:

```python3
from roll import Roll
from roll.extensions import simple_server

app = Roll()


@app.route('/hello/{parameter}')
async def hello(request, response, parameter):
    response.body = f'Hello {parameter}'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    simple_server(app)
```

Roll provides an asyncio protocol dealing with routes, requests and
responses. Everything else is done via extensions. Default routing is
done by [autoroutes](https://github.com/pyrates/autoroutes).

*Note: if you are not familiar with that `f''` thing, it is Python 3.6
shortcut for `.format()`.*

To launch that application, run it with `python yourfile.py`. You should
be able to perform HTTP requests against it:

```
$ curl localhost:3579/hello/world
Hello world
```

*Note: [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/) is definitely a nicer replacement
for curl so we will use it from now on. You can `pip install` it too.*

```
$ http :3579/hello/world
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 11

Hello world
```

That’s it! Celebrate that first step and… wait!
We need to test that view before :-).


## Your first Roll test

First install `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio`.

Then create a `tests.py` file and copy-paste:

```python3
from http import HTTPStatus

import pytest

from yourfile import app as app_

pytestmark = pytest.mark.asyncio


@pytest.fixture(scope='function')
def app():
    return app_


async def test_hello_view(client, app):

    resp = await client.get('/hello/world')
    assert resp.status == HTTPStatus.OK
    assert resp.body == b'Hello world'
```

You will have to adapt the import of your `app` given the filename
you gave during the previous part of the tutorial.

Once it’s done, you can launch `py.test tests.py`.

According to [pytest-asyncio documentation](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio#modes), if `pip` has installed `pytest-asyncio >= 0.17` you will have warnings in command line results. You should read the doc to configure `pytest` correctly. To keep this tutorial simple and to avoid warnings, you can launch `py.test tests.py --asyncio-mode=auto`.

*Note: in case the `client` fixture is not found, you probably did not
[install `Roll`](how-to/basic.md#how-to-install-roll) correctly.*


## Your first Roll form

Imagine a basic login view which is waiting for a username and password:

```python3
from roll import Roll
from roll.extensions import simple_server

app = Roll()


@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
async def login(request, response):
    username = request.form.get('username')
    password = request.form.get('password')
    response.body = f'Username: `{username}` password: `{password}`.'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    simple_server(app)
```

Now if we post our username/password information using HTTPie:

```
$ http --form POST :3579/hello/form username=David password=123456
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 37

Username: `David` password: `123456`.
```

Obviously we do not want to return that kind of information but you get
the point! You also have access to optional `.files`, check out the
dedicated [reference section](reference/core.md#request) to learn more.


## Websockets

Websockets can bring real-time dialog between a client, usually the browser,
and your application.

In a browser, using a websocket requires javascript.

Server-side, your websocket endpoint is declared as a route.
The main difference is that the route handler takes the websocket
instead of the response as an argument. This websocket object can send
and receive.

For our example, we'll implement an echo endpoint that will simply
parrot what it gets through the websocket:

```python3
from roll import Roll
from roll.extensions import simple_server

app = Roll()

@app.route('/ws', protocol="websocket")
async def echo_websocket(request, ws, **params):
    async for message in ws:
        await ws.send(message)
```

The websocket will exit and close the communication with the client as
soon as the endpoint execution is done. In this example, we use an
endless loop that will asynchronously await for a message on the
socket and asynchronously send it back.


## Using extensions

There are a couple of extensions available to “enrich” your application.

These extensions have to be applied to your Roll app, for instance:

```python3
from roll import Roll
from roll.extensions import logger, simple_server

app = Roll()
logger(app)  # <- This is the only change we made! (+ import)

@app.route('/hello/{parameter}')
async def hello(request, response, parameter):
    response.body = f'Hello {parameter}'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    simple_server(app)
```

Once you had that `logger` extension, each and every request will be
logged on your server-side. Try it by yourself!

Relaunch the server `$ python yourfile.py` and perform a new request with
httpie: `$ http :3579/hello/world`. On your server terminal you should
have something like that:

```
python yourfile.py
Rolling on http://127.0.0.1:3579
GET /hello/world
```

Notice the `GET` line, if you perform another HTTP request, a new line
will appear. Quite handy for debugging!

Another extension is very useful for debugging: `traceback`. Try to add
it by yourself and raise any error *within* your view to see it in
application (do not forget to restart your server!).

See the [reference documentation](reference/extensions.md) for all
built-in extensions.


## Using events

Last but not least, you can directly use registered events to alter the
behaviour of Roll at runtime.

*Note: this is how extensions are working internally.*

Let’s say you want to display a custom message when you launch your
server:

```python3
from roll import Roll
from roll.extensions import simple_server

app = Roll()


@app.route('/hello/{parameter}')
async def hello(request, response, parameter):
    response.body = f'Hello {parameter}'

@app.listen('startup')  # <- This is the part we added (3 lines)
async def on_startup():
    print('Example message')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    simple_server(app)
```

Now restart your server and you should see the message printed.
Wonderful.

See the [reference documentation](reference/events.md) for all available
events.
